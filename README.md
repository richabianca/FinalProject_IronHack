#### The Coronavirus pandemic led to over 600.000 deaths in Brazil and this number keeps growing. However,  at a much slower rate due to vaccination. According to BBC Brazil, 30% of fatal cases in the world, is to be found in the country.


#### The goal of this project is to predict the number of potential new confirmed cases and/or deaths by the COVID-19 virus in Brazil, specifically in each of its cities, along the following years.


#### The practical application of the results could be used in the health industry and by health authorities to properly calculate, in advance,  the future demand of supplies and services.
